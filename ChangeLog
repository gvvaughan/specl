2013-02-22  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	specl: set _G._SPEC to allow modules to expose additional APIs.
	When a non-public API is being specified, we need a way to inform
	the module to give the specification access to it.
	* specl (_G._SPEC): Set this to true.
	* src/specl.lua (M): Put _expect into the module table if it is set.
	(matchers.contain): Improve wording of error message.
	* specs/specl_spec.lua (describe contain matcher): Add spec for
	error message.
	* src/specl.lua (matchers.match): Improve wording of error message.
	* specs/specl_spec.lua (describe match matcher): Add spec for error
	message.

	maint: store the version number in the interface table.
	* src/specl.lua (M): Add _VERSION key.
	* specl (prog): Use it in the --version output.

	matchers: compare table key/value contents using contain matcher.
	* src/specl.lua: When checking expectations against a table,
	compare against each key and value in the table.
	* specs/specl_spec.lua: Remove fake specs.
	Specify behaviour of contain matcher.
	* specl: Remove obsolete TODO entries.
	* README.md: Document it.

	formatters: Be consistent when reporting met expectations.
	* src/specl.lua (report): Add "Met" prefix to output.
	(progress): Write "expectations met", not "examples worked".

	matchers: make the contain and match matchers useable.
	Fix some silly bugs preventing these matchers from working
	properly.
	* src/specl.lua (matchers.match): Use VALUE consistently for
	parameter name.
	Set the return condition properly.
	(matchers.contain): Likewise.
	string.match patterns are not anchored, so no need to bookend
	with .*.

2013-02-21  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	docs: initial draft documentation in README.
	* README.md: Rewritten with initial draft documentation.

2013-02-20  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	matchers: make the error matcher useable.
	* src/specl.lua (matchers.error): Take arguments in reverse, so
	that 'should_error' is called like pcall, and 'expect' is a
	substring to match against any resulting error message.
	(report.expectation): Since error messages can be very long,
	reindent multiple lines as best as possible.

	matchers: work properly with _not_ expectations.
	* src/specl.lua (q): New function to quote strings in failure
	messages nicely.
	(matchers): Always return the failure status message, even if
	the matcher succeeded, since it may be inverted later with a 'not'.

	formatters: nicer fail message for report formatter.
	* src/specl.lua (report.expectations): Reformat slightly for
	better english, and to stand out better.

	formatter: group and format expectations every example.
	Fix a bug that counts a FAILed expectation incorrectly. Restart
	the counter for every example, not just at the start of the
	entire group.
	* src/specl.lua (run_examples): Don't save up all the expectations
	from the entire group before displaying, format them after every
	example completes.

	environments: fix the environment sharing TODO.
	* src/specl.lua (run_examples): Pass the correct block environment
	into the block, so that befores share settings with examples and
	afters correctly, and then reset when they go out of scope.
	* specl: Remove TODO.

	specl: implement an alternate format, selected by -v option.
	* specl (options): Accept -v or -verbose.
	* src/specl.lua (run): Add new format parameter.  Assuming what
	is passed conforms to the API, that formatter will be called as
	the examples are executed.
	(formatter): Move from here...
	(report): ...to here.
	(progress): New formatter that just prints dots as examples pass,
	or F as they fail.
	(formatter): Default formatter is the new progress formatter.
	(M): Put the two formatters in the public interface.
	* specl: Request the old report formatter in verbose mode.

	maint: refill copyright notices.

	specl: write a command line interface.
	* src/specl.lua: Don't clobber the global namespace with anything.
	(M): Record and return APIs.
	(Fake specs): Move from here...
	* specs/specl_spec.lua: New file. ...to here.
	* specl: New file. Load the specl module, and use it to process
	each spec file passed on the command line.
	* README.md: Update.

	maint: fix mistakes in pasted copyright header.
	* src/specl.lua: Actually, not part of GNU Zile, and didn't exist
	at all for the first 4 years of the 2009-2013 copyright range.

	maint: add README.
	* README.md: New file. Barely useful at the moment...

	specl: initial import.
