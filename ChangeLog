2013-06-26  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	Release version 8
	* NEWS: Record release date.

	specs: correct output from instantiate_a matcher.
	Without this changeset, output from failed instantiate_a matches
	aresmooshedtogetherlikethis.

	(Process::_type): Likewise.
	* lib/specl/util.lua (type_check): Detect an Object based type
	with `type (x) == "table" and Object.type (x) ~= "table"` rather
	than encoding knowledge about the object layout (which just
	changed with this update, and broke here in a hard to find way!).
	* specs/shell_spec.yaml: Adjust for capitalized type names.

2013-06-01  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	formatters: no need to hardcode 'not yet implemented' in progress.
	* lib/specl/formatter/progress.lua (expectations): Like the report
	formatter, we can rely on status.ispending or expectation.pending
	to hold a suitable string, without hardcoding 'not yet implemented'
	as a fallback.

2013-05-31  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	formatters: insert missing space in unexpected pass message for report.
	* lib/specl/formatter/report.lua: Insert a missing space in the

	strings consistently.
	* NEWS: Update.

	formatters: report 'No expectations' instead of 'nan% of expectations'

	specs/formatter/report_spec.yaml.
	(EXTRA_DIST): Add specs/formatter/spec_helper.lua.
	* lib/specl/formatter/report.lua (footer): When there are zero
	passing expectations, don't trigger a DIVBYZERO, just report "No
	expectations met".
	* NEWS: Update.

	docs: clarify YAML string quotation rules.
	* docs/specl.md (YAML): Not all punctuation forces description
	strings to require quotes, only punctuation that is ambiguous to
	the YAML parser.

2013-05-20  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	matchers: contain matcher now accepts std.objects.
	Now that stdlib objects convert to tables by default (which in
	turn prettyprint with ordered keys suitable for expectations to
	compare against), should_contain can coerce an unknown object to
	a table and search within that.
	* specs/matchers_spec.yaml: Specify desired behaviour when passing
	an object to the contain matcher.

	got us here.
	(opterr): Add a missing period to the end of passed error message
	if necessary.
	(parse): Make unrecognised list an instance variable so that it
	can be augmented in `finished`.
	(M.new): Capture and handle `--` first, as it is a substring of
	long options and might match twice otherwise.
	Accept a comma after a long option to allow multiple spellings of
	a long option on the same line.
	Consume only one `-` prefixed word per iteration to ensure the

	magic characters.
	* specl/matchers.lua (escape, reformat, matchers.error)

	adaptors.
	(expect): Don't overwrite full matcher name, use `matcher_root`
	to hold the matcher lookup key.
	Add support for `any_of` adaptor, mainly for use with `should_not`
	because `expect (1).should_not_be.one_of {1, 2 ,3}` reads badly.
	Call `adaptor_error` when an unsupported adaptor is called.
	* specs/matchers_spec.yaml: Lots more examples to exercise every
	permutation of matcher vs. not vs. one_of or any_of.

	refactor: move long format display from shell.lua to matchers.lua.

	refactor: use Lua "%q" formatting instead of rolling our own.
	* specl/matchers.lua (q): Use Lua "%q" formatting instead of
	manually emulating it.

	matchers: support `one_of` syntax for alternatives.

	(expect.__index): Return a functable instead of a function, with
	a `one_of` method, and a `__call` metamethod.
	(Matcher["one_of?"]): Call the matcherp predicate with every
	table entry, until one matches successfully.
	(Matcher): Add default for `format_one_of`.
	* specl/util.lua (concat): Factor pretty alternatives display
	formatting out of type_error.

	* docs/specl.md (Matching alternatives with `one_of`): Document it.
	* NEWS: Update.

	specl: show description and offset line for example compile errors.
	Previously, if the Lua code of any example failed, Specl would
	dump the stack, usually containing a useless list of nested
	run_context, run_examples etc etc.  We can already do a much
	better job than that... libyaml needs to provide the support
	for full and proper filewise line numbers though.
	* specs/specl_spec.yaml (it reports line of error): Example to
	demonstrate that the offset line of a compile failure is shown
	on stderr.

	examples to verify prettier failed expectation output for each
	matcher.

	matchers: more powerful matcher result message API.
	* specl/matchers.lua (Matcher): Don't add spaces and commas auto-
	matically, assuming output always fits on a line, but do set
	format_actual and format_expect to provide that by default.
	Adjust all clients.
	* specl/color.lua (colormap): Add an entry for coloring shell
	output.
	* specl/shell.lua: Use new shell color, and new Matcher formatting
	API to present nicely formatted output and error stream display.

	(matchers.contain_error): Implement new matchers.

	checked.

	specs: test the correct matcher when tickling errors.
	* specs/shell_spec.yaml (contain_output matcher): Don't call the
	should_output matcher by mistake!

	shell: use the correct parameter name.
	* specl/shell.lua (matchers.match_output, matchers.contain_output):
	Format a correctly named parameter.

2013-05-07  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	matchers: fix a message typo.
	* specl/matchers.lua (matchers.error): 'containing' has only one 'a'!

	util: matching a nil parameter with "any" type_check is ok!

	* specl/matchers.lua (q): Export `q` to ease creation of additional
	matchers in other modules.
	* specl/shell.lua (exit, output, match_output, contain_output): New
	matchers for querying the state of a `Process` from `spawn`.

	* src/specl.lua (initenv.require): Support consistent use of
	`require "foo"` to import foo's global symbols into the local

	* specs/specl_spec.yaml (describe specl before): Move from
	here...
	* src/specl.lua (run): Top level now has hoisted before and
	afters, so pass it to `run_examples` rather than `run_contexts`.

	compiled code now that we only support YAML specs.
	(compile_example): Simplify accordingly.

	specl: initialise spec environments earlier.
	* src/specl.lua (run_examples): initialise with local symbols
	earlier, so that they are available to before and after blocks.

	specl: require now works intuitively from a spec file.
	* specs/environmest_spec.yaml (describe environments): Change
	specifications to how require calls should affect the lookup of
	symbols they define.
	* src/specl.lua (initenv): Before deferring to the system
	loaders, try to find a required file along package.path and if
	found, load it in the context of the innermost environment.

	`require` works properly in spec files now.
	* NEWS: Update.

	specl: support multi-document YAML stream files.

	Release version 5
	* NEWS: Record release date.

	* GNUmakefile: Adjust, and correct typo found by sanity checks.
	* Makefile.am (release_extra_dist): Override this, because we're
	not using the huge rewritten gnulib bootstrap (there's no need

	conf).
	* docs/specl.md: Remove trailing whitespace.

2013-04-28  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	AUTHORS: Fix a typo.

	mkrockspecs: rewritten to load a yaml conf.
	* rockspec.conf: New file. Specl specific rockspec configuration.
	* build-aux/mkrockspecs: Rewritten.  Works like a real program
	now, processing options and loading configuration from a
	standard './rockspec.conf' in YAML format, otherwise stdin.
	* build-aux/rockspec-template.lua: Remove. Baked into mkrockspecs
	now, instead.
	* build-aux/luarocks.mk: Move from here...
	* build-aux/rockspecs.mk: ...to here.
	($(package_rockspec), $(scm_rockspec)): Adjust for lack of
	template.
	* Makefile.am: Adjust includes for new file location.

	maint: factor out useful common make rules.
	* build-aux/luarocks.mk: New file. Factored out of...
	* Makefile.am: ...here.
	* build-aux/release.mk: New file. Factored out of...

	* .gitignore, build-aux/.git-ignore: Adjust.

	maint: use NEWS based release notes for woger.
	* GNUmakeflie (release-prep-hook): Set to default release-prep
	rule.
	(announcement): New rule. Output the relevant section of NEWS.
	(release-prep): New rule. Generate a release announcement, plus
	assorted post-release book-keeping.
	(release): Use it.

	maint: refactor maintainer release rules.
	* GNUmakefile: Re-order so that the main 'release' and then 'alpha
	beta stable' rules are at the top, with everything else following
	in normal execution order.
	(release, alpha beta stable, check-in-release-branch): No need
	to tie rule commands together with '&& \' suffixes, just to
	make sure the rule aborts on the first error... make does that
	anyway!
	(news-today): Rename from this...
	(today): ...to this.
	(PREV_VERSION): No need to assign with :=, calling $(shell) runs
	immediately anyway.
	(unpack-distcheck-release): Inline to only caller.

	maint: abort release with uncommitted changes.
	* GNUmakefile (vc-diff-check): Git optimised version of the
	vc-diff-check rule from gnulib/maint.mk.
	(alpha beta stable): Use it.

	maint: only push new refspecs on release.
	* GNUmakefile (GIT_PUBLISH): Remove.
	(release): Explicitly push master, release and the new release
	tag from each.

	maint: fix VPATH builds of rockspecs.
	Now that we ship the release rockspec, it needs to work with a
	VPATH build otherwise distcheck doesn't complete.
	* build-aux/mkrockspecs: make already knows where it wants the
	output file, so just write to stdout...
	* Makefile.am: ...which is redirected to the correct location at
	make time.
	* build-aux/mkrockspecs: Move rockspec lint call from here...
	* Makefile.am: ...to here.

	configury: use configure to find sed and egrep.
	* GNUmakefile (EGREP, SED): Remove.
	* configure.ac (AC_PROG_EGREP, AC_PROG_SED): Add.

	maint: remove GNUisms from do-release-commit-and-tag.
	* build-aux/do-release-commit-and-tag: Allow non-dot version
	numbers.
	Use a nicer commit message: 'Release version vNNN'.
	(func_sort_ver): New function.  Use it instead of GNU only
	'sort -V'.
	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Add do-release-commit-and-tag.

	maint: adopt do-release-commit-and-tag plus Make rules from gnulib.
	* build-aux/do-release-commit-and-tag: New file, from gnulib.
	* .prev-version: New file.  Previous release version number,
	required by do-release-commit-and-tag.
	* GNUmakefile: Add associated rules from gnulib GNUmakefile and
	maint.mk to improve make automated releases.
	(rockspecs): Move rockspec rules from here...
	* Makeflie.am (rockspecs): ...to here.
	(EXTRA_DIST): Add release rockspec.

	maint: use a NEWS file for user visible changes.
	* NEWS: New file.  Import RELEASE-NOTES from earlier releases.
	* .gitignore: Update.

	maint: improve the release rules for single directory process.
	* GNUmakefile: Tidy up formatting, and then simplify and fix
	release rules to always add only released files to the release
	branch.

	formatters: load unprefixed formatters from LuaRocks install.
	Now that we correctly install Specl lua files with LuaRocks, they
	are actually moved into the standard LUA_PATH automatically.  So,
	the long $(luadir)/specl/formatter/?.lua won't find them, and we
	have to augment the --formatter optarg on load failure to look in
	the right directory under the standard LUA_PATH.
	* src/src.mk (INSTALL_PATH): Remove useless formatter segment.
	* specl/version.lua.in (M["--formatter"]): If straight formatter
	load fails, try again with "specl.formatter." prefixed.

	specl: remove loadstring fallback for failed yaml load.

	if the yaml.load fails.

	configury: make sure we have a src subdir in VPATH builds.
	* src/src.mk (src/specl): Make a `src` sub-directory if we don't
	already have one.

	maint: move specl and specl.lua to a new src directory.
	Previously, when setting the path to .../specl/?.lua so that
	`require "specl"` works, it also means that `require "std"` will
	find `.../specl/std.lua` instead of lua-stdlib's installed version.
	* specl/specl.in, specl/specl.lua: Move from here...
	* src/specl.in, src/specl.lua: ...to here.
	* specl/specl.mk: Move all but nobase_dist_lua_DATA from here...
	* src/src.mk: New file. ...to here.
	* specl/.gitignore: Move /specl from here...
	* src/.gitignore: New file. ...to here.
	* Makefile.am: Include new src.mk makeflie fragment.
	* specs/formatters_spec.yaml, specs/matcher_spec.yaml,
	specs/specl_spec.yaml: Adjust for new location of specl program.
	* rockspecs.lua: Make sure we install to the directory LuaRocks
	knows about.

	os.clock, to get wall clock time instead of CPU seconds burned.
	* specl/formatter/progress.lua (footer): Likewies when calculating
	the elapsed time to display.
	* specl/formatter/report.lua (footer): Likewise.

	specs: remove speclc and lua spec compatibility.
	There is too much magic involved in hand-writing a compatible
	Lua format specfile now.  Remove support and simplify accordingly.
	* build-aux/speclc.in: Remove.
	* specs/specs.mk: Remove speclc creation and all invocations.
	(.yaml.lua, specl_LUASPECS): Remove.

	configury: move to updated lua-stdlib machinery.
	* build-aux/mkrockspecs.lua: Remove...
	* build-aux/mkrockspecs: ...and replace with lua-stdlib master
	version.
	* specl-rockspec.lua: Move from here...
	* rockspecs.lua: ...to here.
	* GNUmakefile: Adjust accordingly.

	configury: simplify bootstrap a little.
	* bootstrap.conf: Remove.
	* bootstrap: Create ChangeLog stub. Call autoreconf. Nothing more.
	* GNUmakefile (Makefile.in): Remove unused bootstrap arguments.

	configury: remove spurious ROCKSPEC_ENV reference.
	* GNUmakefile (MKROCKSPECS): Remove unused $(ROCKSPEC_ENV).

2013-04-09  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	* README.md (SPECL): Add missing 'a'.
	(Installation): Specl uses bootstrap, not autoreconf.

	configury: remove checks for C compilation.

	* configure.ac (AC_INIT): Bump version number to 5.

	matchers: error matcher no longer requires reversed arguments.
	* specs/matchers_spec.yaml (error matcher): Specify all the
	behaviours of a normal argument order `should_error` based
	expectation.
	* specs/speclc_spec.yaml (it expands the expect macro): Specify
	the format of expanded expect calls.
	* build-aux/speclc.in (dump_example): Implement it.  Use a
	LuaMacro to inject a pcall into the expect expression.
	* specl-rockspec.lua (dependencies): Add luamacro >= 2.2.0.
	* specl/specl.lua (compile_example): Use the same LuaMacro to
	inject a pcall into compiled YAML chunks.
	(run_examples): Rename expect to _expect in the sandbox env to
	match the name in the expanded expect pcall.
	* specl/matchers.c (expect): New `ok` parameter to capture the
	pcall status.  Pass `ok` to the selected matcher handler.
	(matchers.error): Require arguments in the same order as the
	other matchers, plus a new `ok` parameter.
	* specs/matchers_spec.yaml: Fill in the remaining specifications
	for all currently implemnted matchers.

2013-04-08  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	docs: reorganise and simplify.
	* README.md: Move usage documentation from here...
	* docs/specl.md: ...to here.
	* .gitignore: Adjust.

2013-04-07  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	maint: display build badge for master branch only.
	* README.md: Don't show failing builds from experimental/release
	branch commits.

2013-04-06  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	maint: failing tests now causes Travis CI to fail the whole build.
	* .travis.yml (after_script): Exit status here has no effect on
	failure or otherwise.  Moved from here...
	(script): ...to here, where failing tests will be reported as a
	failing build.

	specs: propagate package.path to specl subprocesses.
	* specs/specl_spec.yaml (specl.before::run_spec): Add the package.
	path to forked specl command so that it has access to ansicolors
	et.al. from the parent LUA_PATH, which may have been carefully set
	to match the interpreter by the caller.
	* specs/formatters_spec.yaml (formatters.before::run_spec): Ditto.
	Also, escape single quotes in yaml before passing to printf.

	maint: pass LUA to all make invocations for Travis CI.
	* .travis.yml (script): Pass LUA to all make invocations.

	rockspecs: fix a typo in mkrockspecs.lua script.
	* build-aux/mkrockspecs.lua: LUAROCKS has only one R in it!

	configury: fix a typo in luarocks-config.lua rule.
	* GNUmakefile (luarocks-config.lua): Come out of single-quotes to
	allow expansion of LUA_INCDIR and LUA_BINDIR.

	maint: remove remaining references to removed speclcpath.
	* build-aux/speclc.in (package.cpath): Remove.

	* .travis.yml: Overhaul according to lyaml recipes.
	* GNUmakefile (luarocks-config.lua): In order to work correctly
	with a given lua interpreter for a particular luarcoks tree, make
	sure to set the appropriate luarocks variables when writing a
	luarcoks-config.lua. Also, take care to honour environment
	values for those variables at make-time, because the user probably
	knows better how their environment is set up than the generic
	make rules can!
	* README.md: Add travis build status badge markup.
	* build-aux/mkrockspecs.lua: Use the user selected luarocks
	invocation to execute luarocks lint.
	* specl-rockspec.lua (build.build_command): Pass $(LUA) as a
	configure precious variable so that latest ax-lua.m4 uses it as

	version available by default on Travis CI server.

	maint: use travis CI server.
	* .travis.yml: New file. Travis CI directives.

2013-04-03  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	maint: update TODO.
	* TODO.yaml (pending support): Remove.  Pending is fully
	implemented now.
	(report line numbers of pending and failed examples): New entry.

	specs: remove nonsense pending with before examples.
	A spec that contains before/after actions is not empty, so it
	is non-sensical to expect that non-empty specification to be
	pending by default, even though it has no non-reserved word
	examples.
	* specs/specl_spec.yaml (it is pending with a lone before)
	(it is pending with a lone after, it is pending with before and)
	(after): Remove.

2013-03-29  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	docs: clarify documentation of custom formatters.

	pending call.

2013-03-24  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	matchers: report pending argument for pending passes.

	argument.
	(M.expect): Copy pending argument to expectations status table.
	* specs/specl_spec.yaml: Remove pending call from newly passing
	example.
	* specl/formatters/progress.lua (expectations): If a value was
	stored in the pending field, display it in the pending report.
	* specl/formatters/report.lua (expectations): Likewise.

2013-03-22  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	formatters: new TODO items for pending behaviour as pending specs.
	* specs/specl_spec.yaml: New TODO items for pending behaviour as
	pending specs.

	matchers: diagnose passing expectations in pending examples.
	* specs/specl_spec.yaml: Rearrange slightly to make room for a
	new specification for unexpected passes in pending examples.
	* README.md (Pending Examples): Document reporting of unexpected
	passes with the built in formatters.
	(Custom Formatters): Document changes to the expectations API
	needed to support this.
	* specl/colors.lua (colormap.warn, colormap.strong): New colors
	for unexpected pass reporting.
	* specl/formatter/progress.lua (expectations): Return unexpected
	pass report strings, and display a `?` in the progress bar.
	(footer): Report unexpected passes in the summaries.
	* specl/formatter/report.lua (expectations, footer): Likewise,
	except of course there is no progress bar with this formatter,
	so display the unexpected pass report in the main output when
	verbose is set.

	formatters: handle 0 expectations gracefully.
	* specs/specl_spec.yaml: Specify "No expectations" behaviour.
	* specl/formatter/report.lua (footer): If expectations was never
	called, then report will be nil; so guard report dereferencing to
	avoid a crash.
	* specl/formatter/progress.lua (footer): Likewise.
	Also, change summary to say "No expectations met" when none were
	given.

2013-03-20  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	maint: bump version to 4.
	* configure.ac (AC_INIT): Bump version number to 4.

	specl: report YAML compilation failures.
	* specl/specl.lua (compile_example): Report loadstring error
	messages.
	Add newline before function closing `end` incase the previous line
	ends in a comment.
	* TODO.yaml: Remove fixed item.

	refactor: move color selection to specl/color.lua.
	To provide a more uniform use of color between built in formatters,
	factor out hard-coded colors and look them up by content type.
	* specl/color (colormap): Tabulate names of some useful colors, and
	return it, defaulting to underlining unknown color lookups.
	* specl/formatters/progress.lua, specl/formatters/report.lua: Use
	it.

	formatters: always show fail summary, use verbose for inline.
	You shouldn't need to specify `--verbose` on the command line to
	get a summary of failing and pending examples, show them all the
	time by default.  The `--verbose` switch now enables additional
	inline reporting, where that makes sense.
	* specl/formatter/progress.lua (footer): Always show summaries.
	* specl/formatter/report.lua (footer): LIkewise.
	(expectations): Show additional inline pending and failing reports
	in verbose mode.

	formatters: support loading builtin formatters by basename.
	* specs/specl_spec.yaml: New specification for using a custom
	formatter by basename on the command line.
	* specl/specl.mk (specl_install_edit): Do as the documentation
	states, and allow loading of builtin formatters with a simple
	`--formatter=tap` command line option.

2013-03-16  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@vaughan.pe>

	Merge pull request #3 from fperrad/tap
	TAP formatter

2013-03-16  Francois Perrad  <francois.perrad@gadz.org>

	add TAP formatter

	refactor formatter
	replace the string 'indent' by the array 'desc'

2013-03-15  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	docs: be more relaxed about literal block markers.
	* README.md: Improve description of when `|' is necessary, and
	remove them from embedded examples.
	* specs/environment_spec.yaml, specs/matchers_spec.yaml,
	specs/specl_spec.yaml: Remove unnecessary `|' markers and use
	fewer new-lines.

	specs: specify behaviour of require calls in examples.
	* specs/environment_spec.yaml (when requiring a module): New
	specifications for use of require.
	* README.md (Environments versus `require`): Document that extra
	care is required when testing behaviour of required modules.

	environments: intercept load* calls in spec-files.
	Make sure that side-effects from executing a load* function
	variant in a spec-file example occur in the example environment.
	* specl/specl.in (clone): Remove.
	(sandbox): No need for a deep clone, because Specl is hygienic
	and puts everything in locals or the global specl table *after*
	the sandbox is created.
	* specl/specl.lua (run): Save references to the unwrapped core
	load* functions...
	(initenv): ...so they can be intercepted and wrapped specifically
	for each environment table.
	(run_examples): Call initenv() before running an example.
	* specs/environment_spec.yaml: A slew of examples to verify
	correct symbol access with load* variants.

2013-03-14  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	specl: isolate specl modules into their own namespace.
	To avoid potential clashes with modules along the load-path of a
	specl client, refer to specl's own modules using the specl name-
	space.
	* specl/specl.in: Use `require "specl.std"`.  specl.lua is
	already in the specl namespace, so no need to prefix that one.
	* specl/specl.lua: Likewise for specl modules required here.
	* specl/std.lua: Likewise.
	* specl/specl.mk (SPECL_PATH): Support prefixed requires in the
	build tree.
	(specl_install_edit): Likewise, for the install tree.
	(nobase_dist_lua_DATA): Move specl/specl.lua from here...
	(dist_lua_DATA): ...to here, so that specl.lua is not installed
	into the specl subdirectory, and `require "specl"` works
	correctly.

2013-03-13  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	specs: make sure Lua specs are compiled correctly.
	Using '$^' passes all dependencies as a single non-existent
	filename - garbage in, garbage out.
	* specs/specs.mk (.yaml.lua): Use '$<', which passes the correct
	yaml input for compilation to Lua.

	configury: move gmake-only SPECL_OPTS rules to GNUmakefile.
	* specs/specs.mk (SPECL_OPTS, specl_verbose_, specl_verbose_0)
	(specl_verbose_1): Move from here...
	* GNUmakefile: ..to here.

	specl: implement our own getopt with no dependencies.
	Lua stdlib getopt.lua ends up pulling in several more stdlib
	modules, which we don't want if specl is to be useful as the
	BDD tool for stdlib itself.  And after removing getopt, it turns
	out we still had a handful of hidden dependencies on stdlib
	ext module behaviours.
	* specl/std/getopt.lua: Remove.
	* specl/std.lua: Implement our own slurp, warn, process_args and
	process_files functions.
	* specl/specl.in (prog): Move from here...

	* specl/specl.in: Simplify with the help of bespoke std.lua.
	* specl/specl.mk (nobase_dist_lua_DATA): Adjust.
	* build-aux/speclc.in: Use our mini std.lua.
	(reserved): Use a table with true valued keys. instead of a std
	set. Adjust all callers.
	* specl/matchers.lua (M): Inject public APIs as we go, rather
	than relying on stdlib table.merge to assemble the M table.
	* specl/spel.lua (M): Likewise.
	* specs/specl_spec.yaml (specl): Don't rely on stdlib nil concat
	behaviour.

2013-03-12  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	specl: break dependency on std sets.
	Being intertwined with lua-stdlib makes it hard to use specl for
	the std specs.
	* specl/specl.lua (reserved): Use a table with true valued keys,
	instead of a std set.

2013-03-10  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	environments: make runner environments more robust.
	Make sure each nested example block uses the same environment
	for before, definition and after calls, and passes the correctly
	initialised environment (after befores have run) to nested
	contexts.
	* specs/environment_spec.yaml: Uncomment previously failing
	examples.
	* specl/specl.in (clone): New function, copied from stdlib
	tree.lua.
	(sandbox): Before loading anything, make a deep copy of the
	pristine global environment to use as a sandbox for running
	examples.
	* specl/specl.lua (run): Add an env parameter, and pass that to
	run_contexts.
	(run_contexts): Remove dead code.
	(run_examples): Set up the sandbox for the current example group
	from the env parameter, and use it for each example before,
	definition and after block.
	Fix a bug that passed the wrong environment to recursive
	run_context calls.

2013-03-10  Reuben Thomas  <rrt@sc3d.org>

	configury: ensure lua includes match lua binary version.
	* configure.ac (AX_LUA_HEADERS): Invoke this macro.

	configury: AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIRS is not released yet!
	* configure.ac (AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIRS): Replace this...
	(AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIR): ...with the buggy old API call.

	specl: factor away getopt.Option constructor.
	* specl/std/getopt.lua: Update to latest upstream.
	* specl/specl.in (prog.options): Use bare tables, per stdlib-34
	API.

2013-03-09  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	docs: document current dir removal for custom formatters.
	* README.md (Command Line): Make note of the fact that loading
	custom formatters from the current directory requires a little
	extra path munging in the environment.

	specl: break dependency on lua-stdlib.
	* specl/matchers.lua: Do not require std.
	* specl/std/getopt.lua: A copy of stdlib-33 getopt.lua.

	that custom formatters are called correctly.
	* README.md (Custom Formatters): New section describing how to
	write a custom formatter.

	maint: support 'make check V=1' and 'SPECL_OPTS=-v make check'
	* specs/specs.mk (SPECL_OPTS): Unless set in the environment already,
	pass -v to specl according to whether or not V=1 was given to make.
	(check-local): Use it.

	formatters: factor out into separate modules.
	For Automake to install subdirectories correctly with a _DATA
	primary, the nobase_ prefix only works when the source and
	destination directories have the same name, so we have to rename
	'src' to 'specl' in order that the new specl/formatters/*.lua
	sources are installed correctly.
	* specl/specl.mk (dist_pkglua_DATA): Rename from this...
	(nobase_dist_lua_DATA): ...to this.
	* src/.gitignore, src/matchers.lua, src/specl.in, src/specl.lua,
	src/specl.mk, src/version.lua.in: Move from here...

	specl/specl.lua, specl/specl.mk, specl/version.lua.in: ...to here.
	* Makefile.am, configure.ac, specl/specl.mk, specs/specs.mk,
	specs/specl_spec.yaml: Adjust.

	on demand.
	* specl/specl.mk (nobase_dist_lua_DATA): Add
	specl/formatter/progress.lua and specl/formatter/report.lua.
	(specl_specl_DEPS): Adjust.

	matchers: factor out into a separate module.
	Get rid of ugly global stats and expectations place holders, and
	factor matchers out into their own module.
	* src/specl.lua (objcmp, q, matchers, expect, expectations)
	(stats): Move from here...
	* src/matchers.lua (objcmp, q, M.matchers, M.expect, M.expectations)
	(M.stats): ...to here.
	* src/specl.lua (run_examples, run): Adjust.
	(M): Remove matchers.

	(M._VERSION): Set from version table.

	maint: ignore .DS_Store files.
	* .gitignore: Add .DS_Store.

	specl: ensure lyaml is built before running specl.
	Parallel make gets carried away without a full and complete
	dependency graph, so be sure to specify that specl doesn't work
	until lyaml.la is built.
	* src/specl.mk (src_specl_DEPS): Add yaml/lyaml.la.
	Reported by Reuben Thomas at https://github.com/gvvaughan/specl/issues/1.

2013-03-07  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	maint: bump version to 3.

	(source.branch): Remove.
	* src/specl.mk (specl_install_edit): Use pkgluadir and libdir
	to match luarocks installation dirs.
	* yaml/yaml.mk (luaexec_LTLIBRARIES): Rename from this...

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Add specl-rockspec.lua.

	specl: always pass a (small) number to os.exit().

	* README.md: Rewritten with initial draft documentation.

2013-02-20  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	matchers: make the error matcher useable.

	that 'should_error' is called like pcall, and 'expect' is a
	substring to match against any resulting error message.
	(report.expectation): Since error messages can be very long,
	reindent multiple lines as best as possible.

	matchers: work properly with _not_ expectations.
	* src/specl.lua (q): New function to quote strings in failure
	messages nicely.

	* src/specl.lua (report.expectations): Reformat slightly for
	better english, and to stand out better.

	formatter: group and format expectations every example.

	the counter for every example, not just at the start of the
	entire group.
	* src/specl.lua (run_examples): Don't save up all the expectations
	from the entire group before displaying, format them after every
	example completes.

	environments: fix the environment sharing TODO.
	* src/specl.lua (run_examples): Pass the correct block environment
	into the block, so that befores share settings with examples and
	afters correctly, and then reset when they go out of scope.
	* specl: Remove TODO.

	specl: implement an alternate format, selected by -v option.
	* specl (options): Accept -v or -verbose.
	* src/specl.lua (run): Add new format parameter.  Assuming what

	the examples are executed.
	(formatter): Move from here...
	(report): ...to here.
	(progress): New formatter that just prints dots as examples pass,
	or F as they fail.
	(formatter): Default formatter is the new progress formatter.

	(M): Record and return APIs.
	(Fake specs): Move from here...
	* specs/specl_spec.lua: New file. ...to here.
	* specl: New file. Load the specl module, and use it to process
	each spec file passed on the command line.
	* README.md: Update.

	maint: fix mistakes in pasted copyright header.
	* src/specl.lua: Actually, not part of GNU Zile, and didn't exist
	at all for the first 4 years of the 2009-2013 copyright range.

	maint: add README.
	* README.md: New file. Barely useful at the moment...

	specl: initial import.
