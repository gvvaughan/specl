    expect (set).should_have (10).members
    expect (coven).should_have (13).witches
- add less_than matcher (with automatic greater_than support
  in expect?)
- add support for shared_examples: |
    shared_examples for any pizza:
      it has lots of cheese: expect (cheese).should_be ("lots")
    describe new york pizza:
      it behaves like: any pizza
- add support for automatic subject: |
    Stack:
      [[implied -> before: subject = Stack {}]]
- add support for automatic require: |
    module:
      [[implied -> before: module = require "module"]]
- report line numbers of pending and failed examples:
    it is quite likely libyaml will need patching to make this happen
